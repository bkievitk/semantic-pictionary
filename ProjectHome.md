This is the code base for the Semantic Pictionary Project (http://semanticpictionary.org/). This is a framework for generating visual representations of words using Biederman Geons as well as a database of these visual representations and tools for managing those representations (Geonobjects).

The project is divided into three primary files:

data: Contains actual data collected from MTurk participants.
semantic\_builder2D: The Eclipse project files to run the Semantic Pictionary engine.
semantic\_builder2DTools: Tools for managing the data from the Semantic Pictionary project.

NOTE: This project has a dependency of (https://code.google.com/p/wordsimilarity/) to run all features.
